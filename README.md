In header part, you can see that there are nav tag and also h1 as well as p tag. In addition, I used almost the same style for each website's header and footer. Moreover, I choose the same color for header and footer, even though I used different background color for body and section part and try to keep website color nice and neat. There are all link in main html which is index html.
